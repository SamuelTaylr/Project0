Revature Project 0 - Samuel Taylor
This project is meant to be a simple game where you travel through a series of rooms and experience a variety of "encounters."  What makes this project unique and 
interesting is that I endeavored to use SQL queries for every possible method and function instead of depending entirely on Scala.  Player health and gold
are both handled, tracked and calculated using SQL queries.
